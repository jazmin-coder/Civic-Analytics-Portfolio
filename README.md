## About
Hi, I'm Jazmin! I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Civic Analytics at UIC. I have a background in scientific research - having completed a chemistry degree, worked in
research labs, and published a paper in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. Throughout my career, I've developed a passion for using data to problem-solve and uncover 
meaningful insights in a social context. As I continue my studies, I'm excited to develop my technical and analytical skills and become a data specialist for the public and
nonprofit sector.

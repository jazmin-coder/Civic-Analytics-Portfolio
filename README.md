# Jazmin Calimano Colon - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Jazmin! I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Civic Analytics at UIC. I have a background in scientific research - having completed a chemistry degree, worked in
research labs, and published a paper in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. Throughout my professional development, however, I've become passionate about using data for problem-solving and uncovering meaningful insights in a social context. I'm excited to develop my technical and analytical skills as I continue my studies and become a data specialist for a community-serving organization.
